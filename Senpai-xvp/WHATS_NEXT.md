# WHATS NEXT: Steps to a Fully Operational AI Agent System

This outlines the key tasks to transition this project from a development state to a production-ready system:

## 1. Infrastructure Provisioning:

*   **Choose a Cloud Provider:** Select a cloud provider (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) that meets your needs.
*   **Provision Resources:** Provision necessary resources, including:
    *   Virtual Machines or Container Instances: To host the application.
    *   Managed Kubernetes Service (Optional): For container orchestration and scaling.
    *   Managed Database Service: PostgreSQL, MySQL, or similar for persistent data storage.
    *   Object Storage: For storing logs, screenshots, and other data.
    *   Load Balancer: To distribute traffic across instances.
    *   Networking: Configure networking rules (VPCs, subnets, firewalls).

## 2. Application Configuration:

*   **Environment Variables:** Securely store and manage environment variables (API keys, database credentials) using a secrets management service.
*   **Externalize Configuration:** Use configuration files (e.g., YAML, JSON) for environment-specific settings.

## 3. Deployment Automation:

*   **Containerization:** Package the application into a Docker container.
*   **Container Registry:** Push the Docker image to a container registry (Docker Hub, AWS ECR, Google Container Registry, Azure Container Registry).
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Set up a CI/CD pipeline using a tool like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions to automate building, testing, and deployment.

## 4. Monitoring and Logging:

*   **Centralized Logging:** Configure the application to send logs to a central logging service (e.g., Elasticsearch, Splunk, AWS CloudWatch Logs, Google Cloud Logging, Azure Monitor Logs).
*   **Metrics Collection:** Collect application metrics (e.g., response times, error rates, resource utilization) using a monitoring tool (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog).
*   **Alerting:** Configure alerts to notify you of critical issues (e.g., high error rates, resource exhaustion).

## 5. Security Hardening:

*   **Authentication:** Implement a robust authentication system (OAuth 2.0, JWT) to protect the API endpoints and the UI.
*   **Authorization:** Implement fine-grained authorization to control access to resources.
*   **Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
*   **Output Encoding:** Encode all outputs to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.

## 6. Scalability and Performance:

*   **Load Balancing:** Distribute traffic across multiple instances of the application using a load balancer.
*   **Horizontal Scaling:** Implement horizontal scaling to automatically add or remove instances based on load.
*   **Database Optimization:** Optimize database queries and indexing to improve performance.
*   **Caching:** Implement caching strategies to reduce database load and improve response times.

## 7. Teach & Repeat Enhancement:
*   Implement a mechanism for generalizing actions based on web context for task templates

## 8. UI Improvements
* Convert to the React code examples given from the basic HTML to a real implementation.

## 9. AI-Powered Planning Enhancement
* Integrate visual layout understanding, for enhanced planning

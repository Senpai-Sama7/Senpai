# Senpai: Your AI Web Automation Companion

Senpai is a modular AI agent system designed to bring the power of natural language to web browser automation. Imagine effortlessly orchestrating complex online tasks with simple instructions â€“ that's the vision behind Senpai.

## What's Real and Working Today

Senpai provides a solid foundation for building sophisticated AI-driven web automation:

- **Modular Architecture:** Our service-oriented design ensures maintainability and allows you to easily swap out components like the planner, observer, or executor.
- **AI-Powered Task Understanding:** Simply describe your desired outcome, and Senpai leverages the power of AI to refine your instructions and create a detailed execution plan.
- **Selenium Automation Core:** We harness the reliable Selenium framework to drive real-time browser interactions, bringing your plans to life.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Built with Python, FastAPI, and Docker, Senpai offers flexibility and runs seamlessly across various environments.
- **Ready for the Cloud:** The project is designed with cloud-native principles in mind, offering horizontal scalability and easy deployment to your favorite cloud platform.
- **Database Integration:** Leverages SQLAlchemy with an SQLite backend for persistent storage of agent sessions and historical logging.

## Tech Stack

- **Python** (main language)
- **FastAPI** for a modern, async web backend
- **Selenium** for browser automation
